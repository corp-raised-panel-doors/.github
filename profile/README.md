<h2>Purpose of Raised Panel Doors</h2>
<p><strong>Raised Panel Doors</strong> is a small Windows-based woodworking utility intended to help carpenters, cabinet-makers, woodworkers and DIYers precisely calculate the sizes of door components for raised-panel cabinet doors or decorative panel doors. The tool automates the complex math required for frame-and-panel construction - stiles, rails, center panels, mortises or routed panels - so that the finished door fits correctly every time. This reduces human error in manual calculation and speeds up door design and construction.</p>

<h2>Main Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for single-, double-, three- or four-panel decorative doors; user defines number of panels, door opening size, stile widths, rail widths, overlay or inset margins.</li>
  <li>Automatic generation of a complete cut-list: all components (rails, stiles, panels) computed with correct dimensions, based on user inputs (opening size, panel count, margins, overlays, cutter bit depth, clearance, number of doors).</li>
  <li>Graphical representation of the door layout - a schematic view showing stiles, rails and panels, helping to visualize construction and check configuration before cutting.</li>
  <li>Ability to handle standard frame-and-panel joinery setups used in woodworking shops: mortise/tenon or groove-based center panel fitting.</li>
  <li>Works as a calculator-like utility - no heavy 3D design or CAD; focuses on dimensioning and cut-list generation, ideal for small shops or hobbyists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>While many modern cabinet-making workflows rely on full CAD/CAM suites (often expensive and overkill for small jobs), <strong>Raised Panel Doors</strong> stands out for its simplicity and focus: it does one job - door cut-list and dimension calculation - very reliably, without need for advanced CAD knowledge or powerful hardware. This makes it accessible for small woodworkers, hobbyists, or small cabinet shops. Its straightforward UI and specialization reduce complexity and learning curve.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The program is meant for woodworkers, cabinetry builders, small workshop owners, craftsmen, hobbyists, DIY-ers who build raised-panel doors (for kitchens, closets, interior furniture, or custom cabinetry) and who need accurate, error-free component dimensions and material lists without using heavy CAD/CAM systems.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using Raised Panel Doors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Greatly reduces risk of measurement and calculation errors - critical when cutting expensive wood or MDF panels. </li>
  <li>Saves time by automating calculations that otherwise require manual careful work with rulers, calculators, and notes. </li>
  <li>Simplifies planning - you get a ready cut-list, material estimation, and layout preview before any wood is cut, which helps avoid waste. </li>
  <li>Accessible for small shops or individuals - no need for CAD skills or high-end hardware, runs on standard Windows PCs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules / Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Input Module</strong>: where user enters door opening dimensions, stile/rail widths, panel counts, overlays/insets, clearance, material thickness, and quantity of doors. </li>
  <li><strong>Calculation Engine</strong>: applies standard woodworking formulas to compute part dimensions - stiles, rails, panel sizes - adjusted for grooves, overlays, clearances, bit/mortise depth. </li>
  <li><strong>Cut-List Generator</strong>: produces a list of all parts needed with precise dimensions, quantities, potentially material amount, to use for cutting or ordering material. </li>
  <li><strong>Graphical Preview</strong>: shows a schematic representation of the door(s) with panels and frame layout - helps verify design visually before material processing. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch / Multi-Door Support</strong>: allow multiple doors in one project, each possibly with different dimensions or panel configurations (depending on user input).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & System Requirements</h2>
<p>Raised Panel Doors is a Windows application. According to download-site metadata, it has been compatible with older Windows versions (Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XP) - which suggests it is a rather old software.</p>
<p>No recent documentation indicates that it has been updated for modern Windows versions (Windows 10 / 11); compatibility with newer operating systems may be uncertain and likely requires testing. </p>

<h2>Licensing and Availability</h2>
<p>The software is distributed as shareware/demo: many sources list a trial or limited version (e.g., 15-day trial) before purchase is required.</p>
<p>Because of its age and limited online presence - there is no active website, modern user forum, or clear version history publicly available - the status of ongoing support, updates, compatibility patches or active maintenance is unclear. Users should treat it as legacy or potentially abandonware. </p>

<h2>Limitations and Warnings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interface and user experience are likely antiquated, reflecting older Windows-era software design. This might make it awkward on modern high-DPI screens or recent operating systems. </li>
  <li>Uncertain compatibility with current versions of Windows (10, 11); may require compatibility mode or virtual machine to run. </li>
  <li>No publicly available source code, community forum, or active vendor support - if issues arise, resolution may be difficult. </li>
  <li>No advanced features - no 3D modeling, no CNC path generation, no modern integration; strictly a calculation utility. For complex cabinetry workflows relying on CAD/CAM or CNC, more modern tools may be preferable. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Small woodworking shops or hobbyists building custom raised-panel cabinet doors without CAD knowledge, needing accurate cut-lists and dimensioning. </li>
  <li>DIY furniture makers who want to ensure precise woodworking without expensive software or complex tools. </li>
  <li>Cabinet or door makers doing occasional custom jobs rather than mass production - where quick, accurate dimensioning is more useful than full CAD/CAM pipelines. </li>
  <li>Restoration or replication projects, where existing cabinet door openings must be matched precisely. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations Before Using Raised Panel Doors</h2>
<p>Because of the age and uncertain maintenance, anyone considering using <strong>Raised Panel Doors</strong> should first test compatibility on their Windows system (preferably in a sandbox or VM), verify output manually, and not assume modern integrations (CNC export, CAD compatibility, materials database). For more advanced or commercial usage, modern cabinet-design software or full CAD/CAM suites may be more reliable. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Raised Panel Doors remains an example of a highly specialized, narrow-focus utility for woodworking: simple, lean, and designed to solve one task - accurate dimensioning for raised-panel door construction. For small shops, hobbyists, or anyone avoiding complex CAD systems, it may still be useful - but its legacy status, lack of visible support, and outdated tech stack limit its suitability for modern professional use. Use with caution and verify results carefully.</p>
